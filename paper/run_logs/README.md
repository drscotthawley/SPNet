`nohup` output log files for runs used for the paper.

Note that Accuracy scores are obtained from lines with "Ring correct counts", e.g.,

```
    Ring correct counts = 158 / 482.   = 32.780082987551864 % ring-class accuracy
```

Reported accuracy scores are averaged over 10 epochs and rounded down.

mAP scores are obtained from end-of-run evaluation.
